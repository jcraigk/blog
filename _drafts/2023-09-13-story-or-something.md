Imagine a grid of squares measuring 1,024 in length and width. It glows before us in a kaleidoscope of colors. These are city blocks. Look down and across these blocks from our vantage point high in the cool troposphere, will you? Let's tilt our gaze up a few degrees until we make out the silhouette of a modern skyline. Skyscrapers and all that. Along that living horizon, now perceive a red-purple giant; a perfectly circular star settling into the grid, radiating its unbelievable ferocity from 93 million miles away.

The city is so close that we could reach out with fingers made of air and touch it. We could inhale its smells if we chose to. What would they be? Hot dogs and car exhaust? Delicious cuisine and summer sweat? Expensive perfume and faux patchouli?

We are moving downward into it now. We keep our gaze is still fixed on the star to which all is eternally bound by birth and death.

This is not a diurnal place, the sun itself is not a cosmological phenomenon, the sun here is a Source, a conduit through which Something Else is directed at a homeworld. This homeworld quivers beneath such splendor: The Source, the splendor, the meaning of the word home and world and conjunction. This is a System.

Descending further into the grid we select a coordinate: 467, 83. We fly by, rotate, zoom in. We see before us a normal city block, convenience store on the corner, a dry cleaner, a music shop, two independently owned apartment buildings, fire hydrant (no parking), telephone poles connected by copper wire. A man sleeps, homeless, in the recess of a double reinforced glass doorway. Apartment residents depart and return, preoccupied, ignoring him. Shadows from an adjacent block cool the cracked sidewalk slabs. It was a hot day but the night is cool. A parched cat wanders and sniffs ocassionally at detritus in the gutters.

A woman emerges from a doorway marked with a fat faded H.
