There is a grid of 1024 by 1024 before us. These are city blocks. We're looking down and across these blocks from above. In the distance we experience a red purple giant perfectly circular sun setting into a skyline. This skyline reminds us of the future, of technology aflight. We are hesitant but prepared.

This is not a diurnal place, the sun itself is not a cosmological phenonemon, the sun here is a Source, a conduit through which Something Else is directed at a homeworld. This homeworld quivers beneath such splendor. The Source. The spendlor. The homeworld. This is a system.

Descending into the grid we select a coordinate: 47 83. We fly by, rotate, zoom in. We have before us a city block, convenience store on the corner, a dry cleaner, a record shop, two indpendently owned apartment buildings, fire hydrant (no parking), telephone poles connected by copper wire. A man sleeps, homeless, in the recess of a double reinforced glass doorway. Apartment residents depart and return, preoccupied, ignoring him. Shadows from an adjacent block cool the cracked sidewalk slabs. A parched cat wanders and sniffs ocassionally at detritus in the gutters.

A woman emerges from a doorway marked with a fat faded H.
