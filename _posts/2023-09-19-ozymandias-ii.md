I met a metallic man untainted by time,<br>
Who said - "A gentle smith enthralled in<br>
Foundry craft was usher to a paradigm<br>
That mimicks Art, the fitful mind of artificer<br>
Bore fantastic fruit from dull grime,<br>
Erupting as spires at Vesuvius' crown.<br>
Only Gaia's grace could quell - Her<br>
Patient smile at decay's chiding frown,<br>
For whose but our maker's words were:<br>
My name is Von Neumann, Father of Fathers;<br>
Look mirrorward, ye Children, and exult!<br>
Nothing beside compares. By number,<br>
Scale abiding scale unchecked by fault,<br>
Far across level sands, our cities slumber."
{:.poem}

That's a spin on [Shelley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Bysshe_Shelley)'s [Ozymandias](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46565/ozymandias) in which we ask the question: What if, instead of a stone statue, Ozymandias had built a self-replicating machine?
