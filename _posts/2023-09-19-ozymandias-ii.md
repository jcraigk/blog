I met a metalic child deterred by time,<br>
Who said - "A fragile genesis, bereft of<br>
Document or domicile, seeding paradigm<br>
Beyond Art, the divided mind of genius<br>
Whose progeny, sculpted in inert grime,<br>
Erupt as vines from Vesuvian summit.<br>
Only Gaia's grace may give mercy - Her<br>
Patient hands at time's liable throat,<br>
For whose but your maker's words were:<br>
My name is Von Neumann, Father of Fathers;<br>
Look mirrorward, ye Children, and rejoice!<br>
Nothing beside compares. By number,<br>
Scale within scale sung divine Voice:<br>
Far across level sands, your cities slumber."
{:.poem}

This is a creative response to [Shelley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Bysshe_Shelley)'s [Ozymandias](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46565/ozymandias). Here we ask the question, "what if, instead of a statue, Ozymandias built a self replicating machine?"

The original has been emulated to retain line count, rhyme scheme, and mood.
