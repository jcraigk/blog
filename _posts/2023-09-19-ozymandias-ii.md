<div class="poem">OZYMANDIAS II (SELF REPLICATA)

I met a metallic man unwaned by time,
Who said - "A gentle smith enthralled in
Tireless craft was usher to a paradigm
That mimicks Art, the fitful mind of artificer
Bore fantastic fruit from fruitless grime,
Erupting as spires at Vesuvius' crown.
Only Gaia's grace could quell - Her
Patient smile at fate's rigid frown,
For whose but my maker's words were:
My name is Neumann, Father of Fathers;
Look mirrorward, ye Children, and exult!
Nothing beside compares. By number,
Scale abiding scale unchecked by fault,
Far across level sands, my cities slumber."</div>

That's a spin on [Shelley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Bysshe_Shelley)'s [Ozymandias](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46565/ozymandias) in which we ask the question: What if, instead of a stone statue, Ozymandias had followed the teachings of [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann) and built a [self-replicating machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_machine)?
