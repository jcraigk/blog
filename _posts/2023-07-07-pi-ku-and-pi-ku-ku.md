excerpt: Exploring "Pi-ku" poetry
---

A Pi-ku is like a [haiku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku) but its phonetic structure follows a 3-1-4 pattern instead of 5-7-5. This means there are only 8 syllables to work with vs 17.

Here's one:

<div class="poem">Eager dog
Rain
Wet mangy hide</div>

It's trickier to write a pi-ku than a haiku because of the reduced bandwidth. The essential expression must be compressed.

One way to write a pi-ku is to start with a simple image on the first line, offer a transformation or action on the second line, and then offer an outcome or conclusion on the third line. The last statement may be a punchline - clever, humorous, or insightful.

Pi-kus can be grouped together into a Pi-ku-ku, which itself follows the same pattern of 3-1-4, totaling a set of 8. The first and last groups may deal with similar subject matter. The lone middle one can fuse the two ideas or depart entirely.

Here's a Pi-ku-ku:

<div class="poem">Eastern Sun
Wait
Now in the west

Rayless earth
Rolls
New day is born

Big planet
Small
From star's view


Her lashes
Bat
Why did I leave?


Framing mom
Smile
Breakfast cranny

Remember dad
Hearts
He left nothing

Young nephew
Laughs
Genuine kid

Middle age
Eyes
Atop a hill</div>
