A Pi-ku is like a [haiku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku) but its phonetic structure follows a 3-1-4 pattern instead of 5-7-5. This means there are only 8 syllables to work with vs 17.

Here's one:

Eager dog<br>
Rain<br>
Wet mangy hide
{:.poem}

It's trickier to write a pi-ku than a haiku because of the reduced bandwidth. The essential expression must be compressed.

One way to write a pi-ku is to start with a simple image on the first line, offer a transformation or action on the second line, and then offer an outcome or conclusion on the third line. The last statement may be a punchline - clever, humorous, or insightful.

Pi-kus can be grouped together into a Pi-ku-ku, which itself follows the same pattern of 3-1-4, totaling a set of 8. The first and last groups should deal with similar subject matter. The lone middle one can fuse the two ideas or depart entirely.

Here's a Pi-ku-ku:


Eastern Sun<br>
Wait<br>
Now in the west<br><br>
Rayless earth<br>
Rolls<br>
New day is born<br><br>
Big planet<br>
Small<br>
From star's view<br><br><br>
Her lashes<br>
Bat<br>
Why did I leave?<br><br><br>
Framing mom<br>
Smile<br>
Breakfast cranny<br><br>
Remember dad<br>
Hearts<br>
He left nothing<br><br>
Young nephew<br>
Laughs<br>
Genuine kid<br><br>
Middle age<br>
Eyes<br>
Atop a hill
{:.poem}
