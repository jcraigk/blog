excerpt: Reflections on visiting Charles Bukowski's grave
---

Yesterday I drove to San Pedro to visit the grave of [Charles Bukowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bukowski). He's buried at Green Hills Memorial Park in what, at first glance, appears to be an unremarkable plot. It was my second visit. Here's a poem about it:

<div class="poem">HANK'S PLACE

It's a quiet place
There's not much talking
but his words are here, still
I'm surprised he didn't etch
a poem's worth
into the granite
instead of just the two

Then again he wasn't one t(w)o
beat around

It's a nice place
There's San Pedro
on a hillside by the sea
industry, villas, poverty, palms
it's all here

I can see why he stayed</div>

As hinted in the poem, in addition to displaying his name and relevant dates, there are two words etched on his headstone: "Don't Try." Having read much of his stuff - five novels, several collections of short stories, and many poems - I have come to understand this as a playful taunt aimed at other artists.

[Roll the Dice](https://hellopoetry.com/poem/68266/roll-the-dice/), one of his most well known poems, begins "if you're going to try, go all the way." In another more obscure selection, [ah...](https://www.poeticous.com/charles-bukowski/ah-drinking-german-beer), he writes, "Iâ€™ve told the students that the thing to do is not to try..." but later admits, "I sit drinking German beer and trying to come up with the big one."

I imagine I'm in a conversation with the man over a beer. Confident from drink, I boldly claim, "Hank, I'm gonna write a great poem!"

He smiles, raises his glass, says, "don't try."

There's a dual meaning here. On the one hand he's correctly pointing out that I'm likely to fail. If I'm not absolutely determined and if failure worries me, it's best to stay out of the ring. On the other hand, he's saying if I'm really serious about it, then I have to see it through despite all the hardships.

Below the inscription is a silhouette of a Rock em Sock em robot. The novel [Ham on Rye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ham_on_Rye) ends with a scene where the narrator, Hank Chinaski, an alter ego of the author, is playing matches of rock em sock em against another youth. He keeps losing but he keeps struggling. This symbolism further suggests that "Don't try" actually means that you _are_ supposed to try.

Here's a poem about my first visit, which I made on Black Friday in 2022. There happened to be a couple of other Bukowski fans reading to each other there.

<div class="poem">MICHAEL AND MILA

I met them at Hank's grave
on Black Friday
while the cluster flies infested the
dying malls
hinged on a hollow holiday
(cash moving from taxed hand to corporate countinghouse
and back again)
We all play that game, even while
deriding it.
At first I couldn't find the thing
in the imperfect rows of memory's markers
sunken, sacred
buried beneath that neat American lawn.
I sought but found defeat, I said
"You've lost it"
And I <i>was</i> lost
on that gentle hillside kept green by death.
Finally I saw them:
one on either side of the grave,
one reading, one hearing, both afraid.
The seeing was like a secret:
reassurance for a wretch
who wondered what could be found
waiting
at a dirty old man's dirty old mound?
I, too, rested with them for a time and
listened to the old man's graceful verb:
I heard about the Bluebird
and I heard about the Mailbox
painted, blue, on the curb.</div>
