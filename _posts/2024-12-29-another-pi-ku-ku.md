excerpt: Some more "Pi-ku" poetry
---

A Pi-ku is like a [haiku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku) but its phonetic structure follows a 3-1-4 pattern instead of 5-7-5. Pi-kus can be grouped together into a Pi-ku-ku, which itself follows the same pattern of 3-1-4, totaling a set of 8. See previous examples [here](/2023/07/07/pi-ku-and-pi-ku-ku.html).

The following employs three separate themes rather than tying the first and last sections together. Let's call it creativity instead of laziness.

Can they do that?

Blinding Sun
Gives
Every eye light

Ocean stars

Destinations


Center fold
My
What lovely breasts


Mike on bass
Scarves
Drops cactus bombs

Fish on kit

Vacuum solo
