Hi, I'm **jck**. Those are my initials. I also respond to **justin**.

I'm a middle-aged heterosexual cis male of primarily German and Irish descent. My personality types are [Myers-Briggs INTJ-A](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality) and [Enneagram Type 5](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-5). My professional work involves **software engineering** specializing in the web stack. I also write and perform music as a **keyboardist** focusing on a combination of classic electromechanical instruments like the [Hammond B3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammond_organ) and modern software instruments like [Ableton Live](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ableton_Live).

My other interests include literature, philosophy, science, and fitness.

I enjoy pondering **pesky questions** like the [Fermi paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox) and the nature of consciousness. I am both fascinated and concerned by what is occurring in generative AI.


## Brief Bio

I was born in the [Finger Lakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_Lakes) area of upstate NY and spent my childhood living on a small farm. My parents were medical professionals but they operated the place as a side project. Eschewing farm chores, I began programming adventure games on an old [Apple IIe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIe) at age 10.

I was home schooled until fifth grade at which point I began attending a public rural school. I earned a BS in IT at [RIT](https://www.rit.edu/) and remained in Rochester, NY for a few years. In 2006 I moved to San Francisco in search of warmer weather and a larger tech community. Finally in 2013 I moved to Irvine and have since remained in Southern California.
