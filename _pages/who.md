Hi, I'm **jck**. Those are my intials. I also respond to **justin**.

I'm a middle-aged heterosexual cismale of primarily German and Irish descent. My personality types are [Myers-Briggs INTJ-A](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality) and [Enneagram Type 5](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-5). My professional work involves **software development** specializing in the web stack. I also write and perform music as a **keyboardist** focusing on classic electronmechanical instruments like the [Hammond B3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammond_organ).

My interests include music performance and production, software development, gaming, literature, philosophy, science, and fitness.

I think about **gnawing questions** like the [Fermi paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox) and the nature of consciousness a lot. I am fascinated and horrified by what is occuring in the artificial cognition space.


## Brief Bio

I was born in the [Finger Lakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_Lakes) area of upstate NY and spent my childhood living on a small farm. My parents were medical professionals but they operated the place as a side project. Eschwing farm chores, I began programming adventure games on an old [Apple IIe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIe) at age 10. I was hooked on the machine then and am even more hooked on it now.

As a child I showed symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder although I was never professionally diagnosed. One of my strange behaviors was counting right angles in my surroundings. I couldn't stop and I didn't tell my peers. At age 13 I discovered **cannabis**, which significantly improved things for me. I still use [THC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahydrocannabinol) on a daily basis to maintain cognitive health.

I was home schooled until fifth grade at which point I attended public school in rural upstate New York. I earned a BS in IT at [RIT](https://www.rit.edu/) and remained in [Rochester, NY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester,_New_York) for a few years. In 2006 I moved to [San Francisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco) in search of warmer weather and a larger tech community. In 2013 I moved to [Irvine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irvine,_California) to write software at a AAA videogame company followed by a cannabis company, which went from startup to publicly traded.

I currently focus on random software, music, and creative writing projects. Please see my [projects](/projects) and [posts](/) to learn more.
