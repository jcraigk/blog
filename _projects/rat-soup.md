[Rat Soup](https://ratsoup.com/) is a funk/soul band I've been involved with since 2013. The trumpet player is an old friend of mine from college. We both attended [RIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester_Institute_of_Technology) circa 2000 and met in music theory class. After graduating he moved to Huntington Beach to work at Boeing while I stayed back in Rochester. Eventually I also found myself in southern California for a job, and it just so happened his seven piece funk band needed a keyboardist.

In Rat Soup we focus on the classic sounds of the 60's, 70's, and 80's. [My rig](/projects/musical-keyboard-rig) is perfect for this genre. The B3 does most of the work while the Nord produces authentic Rhodes, Wurli, clavinet, piano, and even some decent synth sounds. I also use it for playing samples to fill in spaces in the music.

We have a residency at [J King Neptunes](https://www.jkingneptune.com/) and play [Rock n Roll Running Series](https://www.runrocknroll.com/) events among many other stages. We bring a family friendly party atmosphere and love to see our audiences get up and shake it out.

Takeaways:
  * There are few higher states than playing in a band when things are cookin'
