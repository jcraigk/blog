Musical albums are a marvelous artform. They can take you away for a time, and it's a place you can keep returning to. Each phase of life can bring out previously unheard or misundestood lyrics, bring new meaning to a familiar work. When I discover a new album that catches my ear, I listen to it obsessively until I have internalized it.

My journey in music has mostly centered around live performance, collaborating with other musicians. That's what I enjoy most about playing music. Sight reading and classical are great for preparation, but they are not what move me. There has to be a danceable beat.

In 2010 after playing in San Francisco area bands for a few years, I decided to make an album with an indie rock piano style. I had been influenced by many artists and wanted to include elements of the following: Pink Floyd, Ben Folds, Phish, John Medeski, Sufjan Stevens, Keith Jarrett, Wilco, and early Genesis.

Through a musical friend I found a studio off Cesar Chavez in SF. It was just around the corner from Secret Studios where I practiced. They had a great set of keyboard instruments including a grand piano and several classic analog synthesizers. It was a perfect match for me.

The owners were kind enough to give me the keys to the place so that I could come in on nights and weekends to work. I was proficient enough around the studio after having looked over their shoulders during daytime recording sessions that I could record simple parts in the control room and edit on Pro Tools without needing to spend money on a professional engineer. When it came to recording B3, Piano, or other acoustic instruments, that required at least another engineer present.

Over the course of a year, with the help of several friends and hired guns, [Phasmaphobe](https://open.spotify.com/album/6yHMtyCj5BSFMT0K8fh3WA?si=cftA2RvQTxOMgORRSTIqKg) materialized.

The album cover was done by my good friend and old bandmate Rob Servo, aka [City Kitty](https://open.spotify.com/show/679sUTc0usZJLEn5rlLb5s?si=d42f52e3a5c4444c). I sent him an image of the [Galaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaga) spaceship and he extrapolated from there to create a wonderful painting that still hangs on my wall.

Having spent so much attention on detail and quality during the recording, mixing, and mastering phases, I decided to get a run of vinyl made so that the music could be enjoyed on a turntable. I was surprised to get a call from the vinyl company saying that [ASCAP](https://www.ascap.com/) had identified copyright materials on the album. One of the songs, [Anything's Impossible](https://open.spotify.com/track/2xyuO5srdPxUuc8dYMAvP1?si=18a2ca563fd44e28), features audio taken from the BBC documentary series [Fun to Imagine](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1118155/), which features [Dr. Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman), one of my personal heroes. Sadly, I had misread the copyright when pulling that audio in. So, to resolve the issue, I called the BBC and managed to negotiate a deal with them where I would pay a one-time royalty fee and be allowed to continue publishing the album.

After finally receiving the boxes of vinyl I had ordered, I set about giving most of them away. I wasn't interested in profiting or even promoting the album. I had completed the goal I had set out to do - make an album. Those around me encouraged me to gather a band and hit the road to promote it, but that prospect did not appeal to me.

Takeaways:
  * Setup and teardown in a professional studio takes a long time and you pay for it
  * Mastering is a highly subjective process
  * Beware charlatans in the music business
  * Always try and see the forest for the trees
  * I love being surrounded by musical people and musical gear
  * [There is no other feeling like](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/39207-if-you-re-going-to-try-go-all-the-way-otherwise) creating a complete coherent work of art
